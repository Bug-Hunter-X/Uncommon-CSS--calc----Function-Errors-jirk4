The CSS code uses a `calc()` function with an invalid operation or syntax. For example, trying to subtract a percentage from a pixel value directly may cause issues.  Another problem could be the use of units inconsistently within a `calc()` expression.  Also, nesting `calc()` functions too deeply can lead to unexpected behavior or parsing errors.  Finally, typos or missing parentheses within the `calc()` function will throw errors.
